1. Ballers
2. Matt Melucci and Philip Von Mueffling
3. A fast-paced physics-based game where the player shoots a blast of small balls against a construction of bricks of different strengths. Bricks may require 1-100s of hits to get destroyed, with one shot per level. At every round, the bricks lower down one block, a new row is added at the top with strength >= level, and you lose if they reach the bottom. Some ballsâ€™ multipliers are placed so that when you hit them you increase the number of  balls for the next round.

5. Development Log:

Matt created the classes, instance variables, and method headers, along with comments on each method and the specifics of their function. Also, structured the main game view with the number of bricks and displayed a map filled with bricks as a basic template.

We primarily discussed our next steps in the breakout room and solidified the division of work, reviewing the skeleton of the project. Since Matt worked more on the prototype, Philip took one more class to code to balance the work. Matt will work on the Ball class and Round class, while Philip will complete the Brick, Multiplier, and Ball class. Then, we will both put together the main Ballz game loop to test for the demo. After dividing up the work, we continued to discuss the function of each method prior to starting the code for the other classes.
