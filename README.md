1. Ballers
2. Matt Melucci and Philip Von Mueffling
3. A fast-paced physics-based game where the player shoots a blast of small balls against a construction of bricks of different strengths. Bricks may require 1-100s of hits to get destroyed, with one shot per level. At every round, the bricks lower down one block, a new row is added at the top with strength >= level, and you lose if they reach the bottom. Some ballsâ€™ multipliers are placed so that when you hit them you increase the number of  balls for the next round.
